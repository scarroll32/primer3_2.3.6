-mv monovalent_conc  - concentration of monovalent cations in mM, by default 50 mM

-dv divalent_conc    - concentration of divalent cations in mM, by default 0 mM

-n  dNTP_conc        - concentration of deoxynycleotide triphosphate in mM, by default 0 mM

-d  dna_conc         - concentration of DNA strands in nM, by default 50 nM

-a  mode             - alignment type, END1, END2, ANY and HAIRPIN, by default ANY (when duplex)

-t  temp             - temperature at which duplex is calculated, by default 37C
